            <p>You can see my imports here, defining a variable for the excel data.
                yt_vids is just dropping the features I don't intend to use. After that, I do a basic 
                plot of the correlation between likes and views.
                You can see a correlation for all of the features underneath that graph.
            </p>
            <img src="images/Data_3.PNG">
            <p>This is a bigger version of the views and likes correlation</p>
            <img src="images/Data_2.PNG">
            <p>This is a heat map of the correlations</p>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>Learning how to make basic judgments on data sets. In the heatmap we can clearly see that views have a 85% correlation to likes.
                A cool thing I found was that dislikes have a 70% correlation to comment_count, while likes have an 80% correlation.
