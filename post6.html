           <p>Overview:</p>
           <h3>Key Projects</h3>
           <h5>Journey Maps</h5>
            <p>I joined in on a project that was intented to help workers at Blue Cross understand what the customer is going through as he/she proceeds through the process of getting accepted for healthcare.</p>
           <br>
           <p>I learned a lot about the design flow. I learned how companies use design thinking to help them get into the customers shoes. I learned how to work with others on a whiteboard to layout the customer experience.</p>

           <h5>Empathy Maps</h5>
           <p>Blue Cross did several different interviews and research to come up with five different customer templates, such as Settled Survivor or Convenience Conformer. They applied traits to these specific groups. I was tasked of designing rough drafts of empathy maps, which are used to understand how the user feels and really understand the customers perspective. </p>
           <p>I talked with my mentor to create some Empathy Maps. I read a lot of articles on the design process for these maps. I learned how companies use them to market and design.</p>

           <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
           <p>Designers analyze other competitors to come up with pros and cons in order to inform their design. I studied the User Experience of three different health care websites, I picked functionality on their website to compare, and I came up with ideas on how to make the Blue Cross website better</p>
           <p>I learned how to analyze design and compare. This is very helpful and can be used in many different cases. How do customers experience the Macbook vs the Microsoft PC ? What makes customer lean towards one side vs the other? I learned how to come up with those analysis and present the data.</p>
           <h5>UX Interviews</h5>
           <p>To get one on one with customer is the only surefire way to test your projects. I proposed the idea of doing some interviews of an audeince aged 21 - 25 to see how they feel about healthcare. In these interviews, I asked them not only about how they felt, but asked them to use the website to try to find a plan that fits them.</p>
           <p>I learned how to write an interview, finding an audience, conducting the interview, and how to probe users for more information. I was able to gather some really good data from 10 people. </p>
           <h5>UX design wireframe</h5>
            <p> This is a work in progress. I am using the information I got from UX interviews to make wireframes. Wireframes are a prelimanary design for websites and apps.</p>
           <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
